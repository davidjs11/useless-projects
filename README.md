# useless arduino projects
i don't have many components; there won't be a lot of projects at the moment; also, i should be studying for college.....

## projects I've made so far
- **breathalyzer** with the MQ3 sensor (in development)

## how to use the scripts
- the `load.sh` script loads a project onto the arduino board. you must insert the .ino file as an argument.
- the `serial.sh` script outputs the serial signal on the terminal. uou must insert the correct baudrate (I'll use 9600 in every project).
